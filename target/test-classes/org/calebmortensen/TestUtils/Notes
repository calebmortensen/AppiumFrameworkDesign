How to open a Page aka Activity at a certain location instead of the Home/Landing page of the APP:
Activity class wants package & activity (from open declaration)
Navigate to page of app on android phone, launch adb from console and execute:
adb shell dumpsys window | find "mCurrentFocus"
Result: io.appium.android.apis/io.appium.android.apis.preference.PreferenceDependencies
Result: Package/Activity

PageFactory, while a common Page Object implementation in Java, is not recommended by Selenium contributors
 due to various limitations. It does not store the result when the driver locates the element,
 causing it to relocate the element for each operation, leading to inefficiency and performance issues.Nov 28, 2023
 
 If you can't use Appium Inspector to get the info of a TOAST Message, use:
 String toastMessage = driver.findElement(By.xpath("android.widget.toast)[1]")).getAttribute("name");
 Assert.assertEquals(toastMessage, "Please enter your name");

 Native vs Hybrid app (W/Browser) - Need to change Context
 When the browser from the app is open, use:
 driver.getContextHandles();
 driver.context("Webview");
 Set<String> contexts = driver.get.ContextHandles();
 for(String contextName : contexts)
 {
 System.out.println(contextName);
 }
 // This outputs NATIVE & BROWSER data, so copy from console
 driver.context("WEBVIEW_com.androidsample.generalstore");
 
 Sent a question to Udemy - can you replace the chromium driver exe with 'appium driver install chromium'?
 
 So the better way of locating the element, Priority wise should be in the list
 [id, name, linkText, partialLinkText, tagName, className, cssSelector, xpath]
